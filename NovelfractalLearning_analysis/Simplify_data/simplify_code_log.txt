One way to adapt segment path/or etc so that they can plot together and separately:
use:
if exist(*,  'var')

end

Main figure for brain area?

%% make the nsuplot input parameter smaller:
Sampleneuron, SDF_plot_Crossvalidation, SDF_Crossvalidation_infonewtask:
Can't test the code because there is no SDFs, remain unchanged for now.

Check the additional analysis, does it give the right plot when remake the structs?

% To do, use sampleneuron as example to do the indices calculation.

% To do: text whether the number of neuronlist and that sum in the files are the same?

% To do: (index-0.5)*2

Main figure for brain area?

%% make the nsuplot input parameter smaller:

Check the additional analysis, does it give the right plot when remake the structs?(Yes)

% To do, use sampleneuron as example to do the indices calculation.(Done)

% To do: Include more fields in the single session neuronlist: additional analyses need those.

$ Why the total neuron number in the neuronlist_all(n=17749) are different from the one that counts each file(n = 17798)
 separately?(done, because we also used the exclusion criterion in infonew task)

To do: change the field content in the filename(done)

To do: Add error message for unable to find raw data.

To do: Neuronlist_good-> Neuronlist_all

To do: Check why learning_ind is in the struct array, and same for "acrossdayforgetroc"

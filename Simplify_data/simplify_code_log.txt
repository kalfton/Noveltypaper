One way to adapt segment path/or etc so that they can plot together and separately:
use:
if exist(*,  'var')

end

Main figure for brain area?

%% make the nsuplot input parameter smaller:

Check the additional analysis, does it give the right plot when remake the structs?(Yes)

% To do, use sampleneuron as example to do the indices calculation.(Done)

% To do: Include more fields in the single session neuronlist: additional analyses need those.

$ Why the total neuron number in the neuronlist_all(n=17749) are different from the one that counts each file(n = 17798)
 separately?(done, because we also used the exclusion criterion in infonew task)

To do: change the field content in the filename(done)

To do: Add error message for unable to find raw data.(done)

To do: Neuronlist_good-> Neuronlist_all(done)

To do: in the learning_forgetting plot: get rid of the horizontal bar, and maybe refactoring the code of the brain area plots.
Refactoring the brain area code: See if all field in pars are needed, and whether I can put some specific parameters in global pars to specific function?
Get rid of warning.
Maybe change the brain area names to be the same as that in our paper?

Alg:
Commit
Delete old code, rename the file.
Comit again.
